 Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the dataset's structure and compute key statistics such as average age, investment distribution, and common savings objectives.
 
 **Gender-Based Analysis**: 
 Compare investment choices (equity, mutual funds, government bonds) across different genders to identify significant trends and preferences.
 
**Objective Analysis**
 Examine the correlation between savings objectives (e.g., Capital Appreciation) and investment avenues (e.g., Equity) to understand how different goals influence investment decisions.
 
**Investment Duration and Frequency**:
Visualize the distribution of investment durations and analyze the frequency of investment monitoring to assess their impact on investment preferences.

 **Reasons for Investment**: 
 Identify and visualize the most frequently cited reasons for investing, such as Better Returns or Tax Benefits.
 
**Source of Information**:
Analyze and visualize the sources of investment information (e.g., Newspapers, Internet) to determine which channels are most relied upon by investors.
